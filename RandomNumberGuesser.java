/*
 *  Class: CMSC203 CRN 202330
 *Program: Assignment #2
 *Instructor: Dr.Grinberg
 *Summary of Description: This application will get a userâ€™s input as a guess and report it if the guess is the random number that is generated. It will then narrow down the choices according to the previous guess and will loop to prompt user to keep guessing until they are correct. 
 *Due Date: 02/20/23 
 *Integrity Pledge: I pledge that I have completed the programming assignment independently.
 *I have not copied the code from a student or any source.
